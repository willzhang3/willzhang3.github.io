# About Me {#about-me}
Weijia Zhang is a final-year Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou, advised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ) and [Prof. Hao Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=66KKZR4AAAAJ). His research primarily focuses on advancing machine learning and data mining methodologies for modeling, understanding, and reasoning over spatio-temporal data (e.g., spatio-temporal graph and raster, multivariate time series) collected from the Earth system, urban environments, and human individuals. His work has enabled more effective and intelligent spatio-temporal prediction, decision-making, and AI foundation models, with broad applications spanning Earth science, smart cities, and healthcare. He has published 10 first-author papers in leading journals and conferences, such as TKDE, SIGKDD, ICML, WebConf, and filed over 30 China/U.S. patents. He is also one of 10 global recipients of the 2024 Baidu Scholarship.
